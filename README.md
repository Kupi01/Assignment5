# Assignment 5 - API Documentation and Security Enhancement

This is my submission for Module 5, focusing on API documentation and security features. I enhanced the employee and branch management API from the previous assignment with new features and security improvements.

## What I Added

For this assignment, I added several important features to make the API more secure and well-documented:

1. Security Improvements
   - Added Helmet.js to handle security headers
   - Set up CORS to control which domains can access the API
   - Moved sensitive information to environment variables

2. Documentation
   - Created API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Added inline documentation for all endpoints
   - Set up automatic documentation deployment

3. Environment Configuration
   - Set up environment-based configuration
   - Protected sensitive data using environment variables
   - Added example configuration files

## How to Use

The project requires Node.js and npm. After installing dependencies, you'll need to set up your environment variables and then you can run the server. Check the API documentation for details about available endpoints and how to use them.

## View the Documentation

You can view the API documentation here:
